# Sudoku as Constraint Satisfaction Problem

This repository contains a sudoku solver which is implemented by formulating a sudoku riddle as <b>constraint satisfaction 
problem (CSP)</b>. This implementation relies on the python-constraint [library](https://pypi.org/project/python-constraint/) 
developed by Gustavo Niemeyer. It is able to take each possible sudoku configuration of a 9x9 riddle and solve it instantly.
